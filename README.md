Auther : Vikram Ranjan
In this project, I utilized a range of Machine Learning Classification algorithms including KNN, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier, and Logistic Regression on the Diabetes Dataset sourced from Kaggle. Among these algorithms, Gaussian Naive Bayes showcased superior performance, achieving an accuracy score of 77.87%.
